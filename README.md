# Power-BI-Marathon-Project
This project is about a manufacturing company that recieves and orders for raw materials for production or general maintenance.
# Brief Introduction
Enterprise Manufacturers Limited aim to reduce the downtime and cost caused by the raw materials received and ensure that they are of good quality. The company did not have any procurement team to look into this but has a programme management team that managed to gather data from across the plants with information around the material, defect and vendor. So, I have been tasked as an analyst to help visualize and extrapolate the findings from this data using Power BI. 
## Brief Overview of the dataset
Data was provided by Tina Okonkwo. The dataset is structured and contains 1 table in excel format. It contains 9 columns which consist of: Date, Vendor, Plant Location, Material Type, Category, etc. With 5,226 rows. Also, the dataset is easily understandable. 
## Problem Questions
*  Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest defect quantity? 
*  Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest downtime?
*  Is there a particular combination of material and vendor that perform poorly?
*  Is there a particular combination of Vendor and plant that performs poorly?
*  What is the monthly trend of the categories with defect quantities?
## Tool used
Power BI
## Processes
*  Imported the excel file into Power BI.
*  Used Power Query for data cleaning, data transformation, and data modelling.
*  Created DAX measures for data analysis.
*  Data visualization
*  Report Design

## Key Insights
*  Here are some **key metrics** from the analysis.
